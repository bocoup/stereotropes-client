            What is Stereotropes
          </h3>

          <p class="pure-u-16-24">
            Some of the greatest reflections on society take place in film, through narrative plots, expressive scenery and complex characters, often falling into familiar patterns called “Tropes”. Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience’s minds and expectations. Some tropes are cliché (stereotyped and trite,) while others put into plain sight what is otherwise hidden or unspoken.

            Stereotropes is an interactive visualization experiment, exploring a set of tropes authored and tracked by the community on the TV Tropes. Specifically, this project focuses on gender and the differences between words and associations for male and female tropes.

            Tropes on tvtropes.org tend to have long descriptions, identifying images and a catalogue of film roles that embody the trope. Films are also often associated with a decade or genres. Stereotropes uses this data as a way to capture adjectives used to describe tropes, and associate these tropes within the context of time.

          <p class="pure-u-16-24">
            While tropes are used to cover anything from people, actions and places, the focus of Stereotropes is to present a specific subset of tropes identified as being Always Male or Always Female. This vast collection of data allow us to ask interesting questions about the representation of gender in films.

            About Our Data
          </h3>

          <p class="pure-u-16-24">
            The data used for Stereotropes comes primarily from TV Tropes, found at TV Tropes. TV Tropes is a community wiki where members describe, discuss and track tropes from a wide range of media, starting with television but later expanding into film, literature and more. It is a popular site with thousands of active community members and millions of visits. As a community it is much less formal than a wiki like Wikipedia, so it is important to keep in mind that these trope descriptions reflect <i>the particular biases and mores of the TV Tropes community</i>. That said TV Tropes is the most comprehensive on-line resource cataloguing this type of information.

          <p class="pure-u-16-24">
            TV Tropes data is structured in a wiki format, meaning that it is very loosely structured at best. In order to be able to use the data computationally, we download it from a secondary website, DBTropes. DBTropes offers a ​Linked Data wrapper for TV Tropes. It parses TV Tropes pages and outputs machine-interpretable RDF that we then use for our computations.

            We also augment our data with some additional resources. Specifically, we get film metadata using the Rotten Tomato API as well as the API offered by the Open Movie Database.
