            What is Stereotropes?
          </h2>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            Some of the greatest reflections on society take place in film, through narrative plots, expressive scenery and complex characters, often falling into familiar patterns called "Tropes". Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience’s minds and expectations. Some tropes are cliché (stereotyped and trite), while others put into plain sight what is otherwise hidden or unspoken.
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            Stereotropes is an interactive visualization experiment, exploring a set of tropes authored and tracked by the community on the TV Tropes. Specifically, this project focuses on gender and the differences between words and associations for male and female tropes.

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
          Tropes on tvtropes.org tend to have long descriptions, identifying images and a catalogue of film roles that embody the trope. Films are also often associated with a decade or genres. From this data Stereotropes is able to get adjectives used to describe tropes and see how they are used differently across tropes and categories like gender.
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
          While tropes are used to cover anything from people, actions and places, the focus of Stereotropes is to present a specific subset of tropes identified as being Always Male or Always Female. This vast collection of data allow us to ask interesting questions about the representation of gender in films. Are certain adjectives <a href="#gender">more likely to describe</a> a female or male tropes? How are these adjectives <a href="#adjectives">used together</a>? With this dataset, we can start these conversations.

          <h2>
            Why We Did This
          </h2>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
          Working with data that has to do with gender is really hard. We felt very responsible for the way in which we portray it and whether we are moving with or against the slow and steady effort towards social progress in the ways we talk about gender.

          </p>
          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
To start with, our dataset is inherently binary. We chose only the tropes that were marked as being 'always male' or 'always female'. There was an additional dataset of tropes labelled 'always unisex' that we chose not to use. Our main focus was on exploring the language used to describe stereotypical male and female characters and we made the choice to focus on those because we wanted to highlight the differences in language associated with the two poles.
          </p>
          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
          Our hope is that in exposing these tropes that pervade our culture, we can shed light on them and force ourselves and those around us to confront them head on; to acknowledge our own biases and call out the biases of others. We know that these tropes permeate our media, and that every day people all along the gender spectrum wonder about their place in the world as a result.
          </p>
          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
          We hope Stereotropes can be a small step in bringing us closer to a culture that is more critical in our thinking about the stereotypes reflected in media and the ones we hold personally, as well as more thoughtful about our collective experience of gender in society.

            Interesting Patterns
          </h2>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            In analysing the language used to describe the tropes, several patterns emerged:
          </p>

          <h3>It's not all bad</h3>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            While many of the tropes definitely match stereotypes we all wish didn’t exist, others were indicative of a shift we’re excited to see. For example the use of the trope Damsel Out of Distress, describing a female character that doesn’t wait for her hero to save her, is on the rise.
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-7-24 pure-u-1-1 aside">

          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            Additionally, many of the more degrading tropes are on the decline when we look at their appearance in films over time, for example: Femme Fatale.
          </p>


          <p class="pure-u-md-7-24 pure-u-1-1 aside">
            <a href="http://stereotropes.bocoup.com/tropes/FemmeFatale ">Femme Fatale</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Still… it isn't great</h3>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            We also saw a lot of what we expected to see: Many of the top adjectives associated with female tropes relate to youth, physical appearance, traditional gender roles and sexualiity. On the other hand many words associated with physicality or heroism (and anti-heroism) are associated with male tropes.
          </p>

            <a href="http://stereotropes.bocoup.com/tropes/SissyVillain">anti-heroism</a>
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            There seems to be a greater air of mystery around how women are described, in fact mysterious and exotic are two adjectives much more associated with female characters than male ones.

          <h3>Strange findings</h3>
          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            We did encounter a few surprises. The strong male association of the term ‘British’ and the strong female association of the term ‘Japanese’ was unexpected. There is a large number of anime shows and films catalogued on TV Tropes which could account for the latter surprise.
          </p>

          <h3>We laughed a lot</h3>
          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            There are tropes that capture certain character traits that are really humorous. We found many that amused us or left us laughing out loud. Some of our favorites include: Bad Ass Moustache, Beard of Evil and Mister Seahorse.

            The data used for Stereotropes comes primarily from TV Tropes, found at TV Tropes. TV Tropes is a community wiki where members describe, discuss and track tropes from a wide range of media, starting with television but later expanding into film, literature and more. It is a popular site with thousands of active community members and millions of visits. As a community it is much less formal than a wiki like Wikipedia, so it is important to keep in mind that these trope descriptions reflect <i>the particular biases and mores of the TV Tropes community</i>. That said TV Tropes is the most comprehensive online resource cataloguing this type of information.

            TV Tropes data is structured in a wiki format, meaning that it is very loosely structured at best. In order to be able to use the data computationally, we download it from a secondary website, DBTropes. DBTropes offers a ​Linked Data wrapper for TV Tropes. It parses TV Tropes pages and outputs machine-interpretable RDF that we then use for our computations.

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            Many of the visualizations on Stereotropes rely on text analysis, specifically those that have to do with adjectives. We break down the descriptions of tropes into individual words and then run them through a Part of Speech Tagger. A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This allowed us to extract only the <b>adjectives</b> used in those descriptions and discard the rest. We used python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) POS tagger. We use adjectives in several different ways:

            <li>
              Our various trope pages explore what adjectives are used to describe each trope and how strongly associated they are with this trope versus other ones. For example, an adjective that would appear 3 times in one trope, but only once in every other, would be more "strongly associated" with the first one.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 id="gender-association">Calculating Gender Association with Log Likelihood</h3>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            If you looked at our <a href="#gender">gender</a> visualization, you'll notice that adjectives
            are associated with being "more feminine" or "more masculine". As we extract adjectives out of trope descriptions we associate every single one with the original gender of the trope we're looking at. For example, if the word "cute" appeared in a trope that was categorized as "Always Female" then we will add the word "cute" to our overall collection of female adjectives. If the word "cute" appears in a male trope, we will add it as well to the male adjective collection. Adjectives will often appear multiple times (especially if they are used frequently.)
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            Once we have these two collections of male adjectives and female adjectives, we use a technique called <b>Log-Likelihood</b> to determine whether any given adjective is more <i>statistically likely</i> to appear in one set or the other. The log-likelihood technique is especially useful when looking at corpuses that are of different lengths (which is true in our case, given that there are just more tropes associated with being Always Female, thus leading to there being more female adjectives in our list).
          </p>

            How to calculate log likelihood <br><a href=' http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html'>See here</a><br>
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            To illustrate this, if we take two sample lists for each gender, such as:
          </p>
          <table class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            <tr>

              <tr>
                <td>young</td>
                <td>cute</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>first</td>
              </tr>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            If we compare the use of the word "cute" in both lists, we see that it appears 4 times in the female corpus (which has 10 adjectives) and only 1 time in the male corpus (which has 7 adjectives). To compute the log-likelihood score for each list, we would need to compare that occurance count against the <i>total occurance in the union of the two lists</i>. In our case, the word "cute" appears 5 times in the combined list of male and female adjectives, which is 17 words long.
            <br><br>
            The female score then is:
            <br>
            <code>loglikelihood(4,10,5,17) = 0.20694102481157617</code>
            <br><br>
            And the male score is:
            <br>
            <code>loglikelihood(1,7,5,17) = -0.50595771910690379</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            We can see that the word "cute" is more strongly associated with our female list, than with our male list. We use these scores to <i>rank</i> adjectives
            as being more female or more male in our dataset and use various visualization techniques to communicate this ranking. You can see this reflected in the <a href="/#gender">gender visualization</a> as well as
            any <a href="/#tropes/DamselInDistress">any individual trope</a>.

          <h3 id="exploring-similarity">Exploring Similarity</h3>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            In several places throughout Stereotropes, you can get related tropes or films to explore, depending on where you are. Tropes offer a way to see related tropes, and films have related films to explore.
          </p>

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            To compute this similiarity, we use two different techniques. For <b>related tropes</b>, we look at adjective co-occurance as a measure of relatedness. For example, if the adjective "angry" appears in two different tropes, we consider those related. You can see related tropes by browsing individual trope pages, such as this one called <a href="/#tropes/ProperLady">Proper Lady</a>. In the screenshot below we can see some of the tropes that share the adjective "Good". Note that "Good" isn't particularly strongly associated with this trope versus other tropes, but the adjective "English" is.

            <img class="pure-img" src="/assets/img/about-adjectives.png" alt="trope adjective timeline" />
          </p>



          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            We use trope co-occurance as a measure of how related two films are. The more tropes two films have in common, the more "related" we consider them. We try to show related films that have the highest degree of overlap. For example, the film <a href="/#films/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a> has the film <a href="/#films/Frozen">Frozen</a> listed as a similar film, because they share the following tropes:
            Damsel Out Of Distress, Prince Charmless, Spirited Young Lady, Everythings Better With Princesses, Hunk, Plucky Girl.

          <p class="pure-u-md-16-24 pure-u-1-1">
            On individual trope pages we explore how the use of a trope has evolved over time. We're especially curious to find out whether certain tropes have grown or decreased in popularity over time. For example, the trope Damsel in Distress is on the decline, but Damsel Out of Distress is on the rise!
