    The tropes collected as part of Stereotropes have been used in films throughout the last century. Our oldest films start in the 1920s and continue through to this day. Naturally, we have less films the further back in time we go, but weâ€™ve assembled a few top lists across decades and genres. Click any film poster to see more details about as well as the tropes present in it.
