      <strong>Are there adjectives that appear more often in different tropes, and if so, what are they?</strong> Examining the adjectives used in trope descriptions allows us to more easily understand the kinds of things being said about them. Across all tropes, we were able to pull out about 2000 adjectives that were used to describe them. Here, we collect the top 100 adjectives in that list. Among them we see examples of adjectives used to describe anything from physical appearance, such as ‘beautiful’ and ‘attractive’, to age, such as ‘young’ and ‘old’ and or personality traits such as ‘sympathetic’.
