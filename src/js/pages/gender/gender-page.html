        <strong>In what ways are Female character tropes described differently from Male character tropes?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We looked at the counts of adjectives in trope descriptions across the two gender categories and pulled out those words that are most distinctly used for each gender.

        In this visualization we place those adjectives along a horizontal scale with those more strongly associated with female tropes towards the left and those more strongly associated with male tropes to the right. Adjectives in the middle are more evenly used across tropes of either gender.
