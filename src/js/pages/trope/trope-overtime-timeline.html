    We look at each trope's film appearances per decade and compare them to the total number of films that appear in each decade. For example, '<%= name %>' appears in <%= occurrence_over_time[5][1] %> <%= occurrence_over_time[5][0] %>. There are a total of <%= occurrence_over_time[5][3] %> films in this decade in our dataset, which means ~<%= d3.format(".0%")(occurrence_over_time[5][1]/ occurrence_over_time[5][3]) %> of films in this decade contained characters identified as '<%= name %>'.
