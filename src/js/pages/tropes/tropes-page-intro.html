      Some of the greatest reflections on society take place in film, through narrative plots, expressive scenery and complex characters, often falling into familiar patterns called “Tropes”. Tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience’s minds and expectations. Some tropes are clich&eacute; (stereotyped and trite,) while others put into plain sight what is otherwise hidden or unspoken.

      Stereotropes is an interactive experiment, exploring a set of tropes authored and tracked by the community on <a href='http://tvtropes.org' alt='tvtropes website'>tvtropes.org</a>. While tropes are used to cover anything from people, actions and places, the focus of Stereotropes is to present a specific subset of tropes identified as being <a data-gender='f' class='gender-filter f'>always female</a> or <a data-gender='m' class='gender-filter m'>always male</a>.
