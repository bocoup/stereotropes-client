# Gender Movie Tropes

## Set up

Run:

* `npm install`
* `bower install`

You can run a dev version of the application by calling:

* `grunt dev`

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:8081`.
This set up comes with livereload, so no page reloading should be necessary.

* `grunt public`

This will compile everything into a production version.
